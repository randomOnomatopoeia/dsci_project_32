    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) is a research group at the University of British Columbia interested in collecting data on how people play and interact in video games. PLAI has publicly released a free Minecraft server, plaicraft.ai, a “free Minecraft in the cloud” to enable their project on generative AI research data collection. However, research efforts and resources are demanding in a project of this size, where the actions of each player are recorded throughout their playthrough. Thus, project lead Frank Wood has offered the undergraduate DSCI100 students an opportunity to assist in answering one of three questions related to the data they have accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has chosen to address question 2: “We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.” Based on this overarching question, we created our group question of interest: “What experience levels and ages contribute to greater playtime in hours?” Playtime in hours was chosen as the response variable, as we believe it best captures the amount of data players contribute. Thus, predicting higher amounts of playtime from explanatory variables may yield insight into what player characteristics are most significantly associated with larger amounts of data generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow down the overarching inquiry, player age and experience level (Amateur, Beginner, Regular, Pro, Veteran) were chosen as explanatory variables. Age is heavily tied to life stages, influencing factors such as time availability, patterns in cognitive engagement, and gaming habits, which have the potential to affect total playtime. Experience level reflects player commitment and implies dedication towards the game before participation, possibly indicating the amount of time and sessions players are willing to dedicate to gameplay. Thus, we believed these variables would be influential in contributing the most data and subsequent targeted recruitment by narrowing down the scope of age groups and experience levels most likely to have the highest playtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 196 observations and 9 variables. This includes the columns “experience” (categorical string) representing player Minecraft experience level, “subscribe” (categorical boolean) indicating player subscription to a game-related newsletter, “hashedEmail” (categorical string) as the player’s email, “played_hours” (numerical integer) as the number of played hours, “name” (categorical string), \"gender” (categorical string), “age” (numerical integer) in years, and two empty fields “individualID” and “organizationName” (NoneType). Components of the data were sourced from player activity, actions, and interactions on plaicraft.ai, while other aspects such as player names and emails were self-reported. It is not declared whether player age, experience level, and gender were sourced from a self-report measure or player activity."
