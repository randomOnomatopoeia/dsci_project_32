    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) is a research group at the University of British Columbia interested in collecting data on how people play and interact in video games. PLAI has publicly released a free Minecraft server, plaicraft.ai, a “free Minecraft in the cloud” to enable their project on generative AI research data collection. However, research efforts and resources are demanding in a project of this size, where the actions of each player are recorded throughout their playthrough. Thus, project lead Frank Wood has offered the undergraduate DSCI100 students an opportunity to assist in answering one of three questions related to the data they have accumulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group has chosen to address question 2: “We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.” Based on this overarching question, we created our group question of interest: “What experience levels and ages contribute to greater playtime in hours?” Playtime in hours was chosen as the response variable, as we believe it best captures the amount of data players contribute. Thus, predicting higher amounts of playtime from explanatory variables may yield insight into what player characteristics are most significantly associated with larger amounts of data generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow down the overarching inquiry, player age and experience level (Amateur, Beginner, Regular, Pro, Veteran) were chosen as explanatory variables. Age is heavily tied to life stages, influencing factors such as time availability, patterns in cognitive engagement, and gaming habits, which have the potential to affect total playtime. Experience level reflects player commitment and implies dedication towards the game before participation, possibly indicating the amount of time and sessions players are willing to dedicate to gameplay. Thus, we believed these variables would be influential in contributing the most data and subsequent targeted recruitment by narrowing down the scope of age groups and experience levels most likely to have the highest playtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 196 observations and 9 variables. This includes the columns “experience” (categorical string) representing player Minecraft experience level, “subscribe” (categorical boolean) indicating player subscription to a game-related newsletter, “hashedEmail” (categorical string) as the player’s email, “played_hours” (numerical integer) as the number of played hours, “name” (categorical string), \"gender” (categorical string), “age” (numerical integer) in years, and two empty fields “individualID” and “organizationName” (NoneType). Components of the data were sourced from player activity, actions, and interactions on plaicraft.ai, while other aspects such as player names and emails were self-reported. It is not declared whether player age, experience level, and gender were sourced from a self-report measure or player activity."

    "The main purpose of the initial visualization was to understand the general trend of the data. The plot was made by converting the continuous variable \"playtime\" into categorical bins, done by slicing the numeric column into intervals (bins). This was done so that the ranges in playtime could be color-coded and more easily identifiable, as opposed to mainly utilizing opacity for identification, which has very low readability due to overlap and outliers that stretch the axes, rendering smaller differences meaningless. “Age” was plotted on the x-axis and \"experience” on the y-axis, while the “grouped playtime” was assigned varying colors.

    "Based on the model, played hours (hrs) = -0.08066 * age (yrs) -0.1485 experience (1 level) + 6.937. Our model had an RMSE of about 25.137 hours, and an RMSPE of about 35.45 hours. We expected the RMSPE to be larger than the RMSE because the model was trained on the data used to find the RMSE, while the testing data for the RMSPE was completely new. After using the training data to create a model, we tested the model on the testing data and found the RMSPE to understand how good of a fit it is compared to KNN regression. Based on these two values, we were able to determine which model works better for the data, and thus the one we should use for better predicting playing time based on age and experience level.  The RMSPE for the linear regression (35.450) was higher than that of the KNN regression (34.41), making KNN regression our model of choice. However, the RMSPE’s were very close, so the difference is somewhat negligible. As such, we included visualizations for both models. "

    "Our linear regression model returned \n",
    "played hours (hrs) = -0.08066 * age (yrs) -0.1485 experience (1 level) + 6.937\n",
    "We found that there is a negative relationship between played hours and age, as well as a negative relationship between played hours and experience level.  However,  our RMSPE for the model was 34.45, which is rather high. As such, the relationship is weak. This is probably due to some of the outliers we had for hours played. The vast majority of players had a playtime of less than 5 hours, but some individuals had over 100, making it likley that these outliers skewed the results.\n",
    "We expected the negative relationship between hours played and age because we thought that video games tend to have a younger audience. However, we were surprised by the negative relationship between hours played and experience level because we thought that better players would play more. \n",
    "These findings suggest that basic demographic and self-reported experience information can provide a rough indication of expected engagement, but cannot fully predict individual playtime. For game designers, this means that age and experience could be used as part of a personalization strategy (for example, setting default difficulty or tutorial length), but they should not be relied on for high-stakes decisions about players. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Are different groups of players (such as beginners vs. experts) motivated differently to play, and do factors like motivation or social interaction have a stronger impact on engagement than age or experience?\n",
    "* Do session-based factors like number of sessions or session length predict playtime better than demographics?\n",
    "* Would adding categorical variables like gender or organization improve prediction performance?\n",
    "* How much do social features (playing with friends, in-game communities) increase playtime?\n"
